Stopwatch Web App ‚è±Ô∏è https://stop-watch-two-pink.vercel.app/
This is a simple yet functional stopwatch application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project was developed as part of my internship at Prodigy Infotech to demonstrate the use of time-based functionality and event handling in web development.

Start, Stop, and Reset Functions: Control the stopwatch with intuitive buttons to start, pause, and reset the timer.
Lap Timer: Record lap times during the session (if implemented).
Accurate Time Tracking: Tracks hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.
Responsive Design: The app works across different devices such as desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
üíª Tech Stack:
HTML: Defines the structure of the stopwatch display and controls.
CSS: Styles the layout and makes the design responsive.
JavaScript: Manages the stopwatch's core logic, including time intervals and event handling.
